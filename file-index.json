The endpoint imports `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` from the `next/server` package, as well as the `axios` library for making HTTP requests.\n2. It defines a single function, `POST`, which is marked as asynchronous (`async`) and receives a `NextRequest` object as an argument.\n3.

If either `code` or `enhancement_request` is missing, the function returns a JSON response with an error message (400 status code).\n5. If the request is valid, the function sends a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/enhance-code` using `axios`, passing the `code` and `enhancement_request` as request data.\n6.
